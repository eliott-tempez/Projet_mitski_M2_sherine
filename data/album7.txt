There's a bug like an angel stuck to the bottom of my glass, with a little bit left
As I got older, I learned I'm a drinker
Sometimes, a drink feels like family
Family
Hey, what's the matter?
Looking like your sticker is stuck on a floor somewhere
Did you go and make promises you can't keep?
Well, when you break them, they break you right back
Amateur mistake, you can take it from me
They break you right back
Break you right back
When I'm bent over wishing it was over
Making all variety of vows I'll never keep
I try to remember the wrath of the devil was also given him by God


Mosquitoes can enjoy me, I can't go inside
I'm sucking up as much of the full moon, so bright
Fireflies zooming through the yard like highway cars
Someone out here burning something, kids feeling alive
Freight train stampeding through my backyard
It'll run across the plains like the new buffalo replaced
I have a hope and though she's blind with no name
She shits where she's supposed to, feeds herself while I'm away
Sometimes I think it would be easier without her
But I know nothing can hurt me when I see her sleeping face
Freight train horn howling out mad and wild
Heading somewhere far away like the new buffalo replaced


All of our love
Filling all of our room
Your low, warm voice
Curses as you find the string
To strike within me
That rings out a note
Heard in heaven
Heaven
Heaven
Now I bend like a willow
Thinking of you
Like a murmuring brook
Curving about you
As I sip on the rest of the coffee you left
A kiss left of you
Heaven
Heaven
Heaven
Hear the storm
Dances outside
Something set free
Is running through the night
And the dark awaits us
All around the corner
But here in our place
We have for the day
Can we stay awhile and listen for
Heaven
Heaven


I don't like my mind, I don't like being left alone in a room
With all its opinions about the things that I've done
So, yeah, I blast music loud and I work myself to the bone
And on an inconvenient Christmas, I eat a cake
A whole cake, all for me
And then I get sick and throw up and there's another memory that gets stuck
Inside the walls of my skull waiting for its turn to talk
And it may be a few years, but you can bet it's there, waiting still
For me to be left alone in a room with the things that I've done
A whole cake, so please don't take
Take this job from me
A whole cake, so please don't take
Take my job from me

There's a deal you can make on a midnight walk alone
Look around, listen close, hear it fall from above
It will ask what you'd give and what you'd take for it in return
I once went on such a walk and I found that I'd said
I want someone to take this soul
I can't bear to keep it, I'd give it just to give
And all I will take are the consequences
Will somebody take this soul?
Then, of course, nothing replied, nothing speaks to you in the night
And I walked my way home, there was no one in sight
Save a bird perched upon a streetlight, watching me
So, I stopped and let it watch 'til I found that it said
Now I'm taken, the night has me
You won't hear me singing, you're a cage without me
Your pain is eased but you'll never be free
For now I'm taken, the night has me
There's a deal that I made
There's a deal that I made
There's a deal that I made
There's a deal


When memories snow
And cover up the driveway
I shovel all those memories
Clear the path to drive to the store
And when memories melt
I hear them in the drainpipe
Dripping through the downspout
As I lie awake in the dark
And if I break
Could I go on break?
Be back in my room
Writing speeches in my head
Listening' to the thousand hands
That clap for me in the dark

Moon, a hole of light
Through the big top tent up high
Here before and after me
Shining down on me
Moon, tell me if I could
Send up my heart to you?
So when I die, which I must do
Could it shine down here with you?
'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine
My baby here on Earth
Showed me what my heart was worth
So when it comes to be my turn
Could you shine it down here for her?
Because my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine
Nothing in the world is mine for free
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine


The frost, it looks like dust settled on the world
After everyone's long been gone
But me, I was hiding, or forgotten, the only one left
Now the world is mine alone
With no one, no one to share the memory
Of frost out the window
This morning after you're gone
And the house is mine alone
You're my best friend, now I've no one to tell
How I lost my best friend
The frost, it looks like we've been left in the attic
But you're not here to see
It's just witness-less me


Remember when we met?
We acted like two fools
We were so glad
So glad to have found it
That love is like a star
It's gone, we just see it shining
It's traveled very far, I'll keep a leftover light
Burning so you can keep looking up
Isn't that worth holding on?
You know I'd always been alone
Until you taught me
To live for somebody
That love is like a star
It's gone, we just see it shining
Because it's traveled very far, I'll keep a leftover light
Burning so you can keep looking up/I'm yours no matter
That love's gone
We just see it shining
We've traveled very far, I'll keep a leftover light
Burning so you can keep looking up/Isn't that worth holding on?


You're an angel, I'm a dog
Or you're a dog and I'm your man
You believe me like a god
I destroy you like I am
I'm sorry I'm the one you love
No one will ever love me like you again
So, when you leave me, I should die
I deserve it, don't I?
I can feel it getting near
Like flashlights coming down the way
One day, you'll figure me out
I'll meet judgment by the hounds
People always gave me love
Others were never to blame after all
You believe me like a god
I betray you like a man


Brushing my hair naked
Spritz my face with toner
Splash water on my neck
Laughing in the mirror
Cool water in a glass
Drink it down
How I love me after you
King of all the land
Stride through the house naked
Don't even care that the curtains are open
Let the darkness see me
Streets are mine, the night is mine
All my own
How I love me after you
King of all the land
I'm king of all the land
