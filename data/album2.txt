There's nobody better than you
It took me a while till I knew
But you knew from the start it was us, didn't you?
It just took me a while till I knew
Now I lay as I study a blank wall
Would you spare me your voice if I call?
'Cause you waited and watered my heart till it grew
You just grew a little smarter too
So I don't blame you if you want to
Bury me in your memory, I'm not the girl I ought to be, but
Maybe when you tell your friends, you
Can tell them what you saw in me, and not how I turned out to be
There's some kind of burning inside me
It's kept me from falling apart
And I'm sure that you've seen what it's done to my heart
But it's kept me from falling apart
Now here I lay, as I wonder about you
Would you just tell me what I'm meant to do?
'Cause I've waited and watered my heart till it grew
You can see how it's blossomed for you
And I don't blame you if you want to
Bury me in your memory, I'm not the girl I ought to be,but
Maybe when you tell your friends, you
Can tell them what you saw in me, and not the way I am
And I don't mean to make your heart blue
But could we be what we're meant to be? I'm just about to beg you please, and
Then when you tell your friends, you can
Tell them what you saw in me, and not the way I used to be
'Cause there's nobody better than you




Your room was square
I once noticed from there
In your bed, as you slept
And I held my breath
Everything had its own place
And I wondered what space would I take
In the order you kept
I tried to eat like your girlfriend
Just tea, in the night I'd end up
Too hungry to sleep
So lying awake, I would follow the aching inside
I would find
It's for you won't be mine
I tried my hardest, for I'd never learned
God's very simple and love shouldn't burn
And I would've offered you all that you yearned for
But I was still waiting for something to earn
What is that quiet of snow in the night?
The dark rings with white noise
As you stand and drown
Maybe it's all of these snowflakes, screaming
A choir of mute
As they brace for the ground
Well, that's my ride
Hope you had a good night
You know, you made me happy
Here, shake my hand
You make such a good man
Never once did you know me
I tried my hardest, for how do you learn
God's very simple and love doesn't burn
And maybe you'd offered me all that I yearned for
But I was still waiting for something to earn
Silly me, waiting


I love everybody because I love you
When you stood up, walked away barefoot
And the grass where you lay left a bed in your shape
I looked over it and I ached
I love everybody because I love you
I don't need the city and I don't need proof
All I need, darling, is a life in your shape
I picture it soft and I ache
Look at you, strawberry blond
Reach out the car window, trying to hold the wind
You tell me you love her, I give you a grin
Oh, all I ever wanted was a life in your shape
So, I follow the white lines, follow the white lines
Keep my eyes on the road as I ache
Look at you, strawberry blond, fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm? Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way
Look at you, strawberry blond, fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm? Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way
Look at you, strawberry blond, fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm? Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way
Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah
Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah


I'll live in the bathtub
It's cool and clean
It's smooth and it's steady
It's all that I need
I broke our belongings
They're all on the floor
The room is now empty
Nothing left to throw
All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch
All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch
I'll live in the bathtub
Surrounded by tiles
All so square and so steady
I will die in their cool, cool arms


I broke what you gave me
But you kept giving more
And I'm sorry for taking
But I keep wanting more, more, more, oh
All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch
All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But, Humpty Dumpty, you're much too much
Too frail for me to touch
Humpty Dumpty, it's much too much
All the eggshells are on the ground


I want you
I hold one card
That I can't use
But I want you
You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over
And I love you, darling
And I am done, dear
You're in the house
And I am here in the car
I just need a quiet place
Where I can scream
How I love you
I found you
I found the door
But when I stepped through
There was no floor
You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over
And I love you, darling
And I am done, dear
You're in the house
And I am here in the car
I just need a quiet place
Where I can scream
How I love you
I want you
I want you


It feels so good, it feels so good
And right outside the door nobody knows
They're right outside the door and they don't know how it
Feels so good, it feels so good
I never was very good, I haven't been so good
But right outside the door nobody knows
They're right outside the door and they don't know how it
Feels so good, it feels so good




I can still smell the fire
Though I know it's long died out
The smoke still hangs in my hair
And on some quiet evenings it burns my eyes
So darling, play your violin
I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
We will manage somehow
I once lived in the sea
Bring me to your ear, you can hear
The tide where I used to be
Though now I'm but a shell
Oh, baby, don't say "Sorry"
Darling, play your violin
I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
We will manage somehow
Don't dare regret anything
Remember what you're here for, you
Just play your violin
We will manage somehow


There's a lie that I told to you
That now I can't tell the truth
And it ate me inside, so one soft drunken night
I slept with a man you knew
And in the morning I walked home alone
And the businessmen saw my bones
With my skirt in their eyes, they remembered the nights
When they were that man you knew
You told me once
You were happy to have me
But I never gave me away
There's the lie that I told to you
I would give you my heart, I think
But it's up in a branch of a tree
It was only to tease when he climbed up the tree
Put my heart where I couldn't reach
I didn't mind, I adored him, so
We forgot, and we left for home
And that was so long ago, now the tree it has grown
And nobody knows my lover is buried underground
Nobody knows my lover is buried underground
Nobody knows my lover is buried underground
There's a lie that I told to you


Mom, I'm tired
Can I sleep in your house tonight?
Mom, is it alright
If I stay for a year or two?
Mom, I'll be quiet
It would be just to sleep at night
And I'll leave once I figure out
How to pay for my own life too
Mom, would you wash my back?
This once, and then we can forget
And I'll leave what I'm chasing
For the other girls to pursue
Mom, am I still young?
Can I dream for a few months more?
