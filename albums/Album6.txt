Let's step carefully into the dark
Once we're in, I'll remember my way around
Who will I be tonight?
Who will I become tonight?
I'll show you who my sweetheart's never met
Wet teeth, shining eyes glimmering by a fire
Let's drive out to where dust devils are made
By dancing ghosts as they kick up clouds of sand
Where clouds look like mountains
Clouds look like mountains
Let me watch those mountains from underneath
And maybe they'll finally float off of me


I cry at the start of every movie
I guess 'cause I wish I was making things, too
But I'm working for the knife
I used to think I would tell stories
But nobody cared for the stories I had about
No good guys
I always knew the world moves on
I just didn't know it would go without me
I start the day high and it ends so low
'Cause I'm working for the knife
I used to think I'd be done by twenty
Now at twenty-nine, the road ahead appears the same
Though maybe at thirty, I'll see a way to change
That I'm living for the knife
I always thought the choice was mine
And I was right, but I just chose wrong
I start the day lying and end with the truth
That I'm dying for the knife


Fury, pure and silver
You grip it tight inside
Like a knife
It glints in your eye
It's why I've arrived, your sex god
Here to take you where
You need to go
To where the dark remembers you
Open up your heart
Like the gates of Hell
You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up
I am face down on my bed
Still not quite awake yet
Thinking of you
I tuck my hand under my weight
Just tell me what you want to do
Tell me what you want
To burn away
'Cause I could be your stoker
Open up your heart
Like the gates of Hell
You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up


Everyone, all of them
Everyone said, "Don't go that way"
So, of course, to that, I said
"I think I'll go that way"
And I left the door open to the dark
I said, "Come in, come in, whatever you are"
But it didn't want me yet
Then like a babe in a crib
After some big hand turns out the light
And I opened my arms wide to the dark
I said, "Take it all, whatever you want"
I didn't know that I was young
I didn't know what it would take
I didn't know what it would take
Sometimes I think I am free
Until I find I'm back in line again


Heat lightning running outside the window
I've laid awake since one and now it's four o'clock
Though I've held on, can't carry it much longer
On the ceiling dancing are the things all come and gone
And there's nothing I can do, not much I can change
So I give it up to you, I hope that's okay
There's nothing I can do, not much I can change
I give it up to you, I surrender
Heat lightning, watch it from my doorstep
Sleeping eyelid of the sky flutters in a dream
Well, I've held on, but feel a storm approaching
Trees are swaying in the wind like sea anemones
And there's nothing I can do, not much I can change
Can I give it up to you? Would that be okay?
There's nothing I can do, not much I can change
I give it up to you, I surrender
There's nothing I can do, not much I can change
I give it up to you, I surrender


If you would just make one mistake
What a relief that would be
But I think for as long as we're together
I'll be the only heartbreaker
I'll be the only heartbreaker
I'll be the only heartbreaker
So I'll be the loser in this game
I'll be the bad guy in the play
I'll be the water main that's burst and flooding
You'll be by the window, only watching
I'll be the only heartbreaker
I'll be the only heartbreaker
(I apologize)
(You forgive me)
(I apologize)
(You forgive me)
And make me the only heartbreaker
So I'll be the only heartbreaker


If I keep myself at home
I won't make the same mistake
That I made for fifteen years
I could be a new girl
I will be a new girl
I wish that this would go away
But when I'm done singing this song
I will have to find something else
To do to keep me here
Something else to keep me
Here's my hand
There's the itch
But I'm not supposed to scratch
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out
How do other people live?
I wonder how they keep it up
When today is finally done
There's another day to come
Then another day to come
Then another day to
Come back to mine
We'll pretend it ends tomorrow
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more


There's nothing left for you, nothing in this room
Try and go outside, nothing waits for you
You had it once before, not anymore
So go on to that sweetheart's door
And find a new you
Give her all the love
You saved for it
You could touch fire, you could fly
It was your right, it was your life
And then it passed to someone new
It'll keep passing on long after you
But you're the only one
She's counting on
There's nothing left for you


Well, I went through my list of friends and found
I had no one to tell
Of this overwhelming clean feeling
Strange serenity
When I saw the girl looked just like me
And it broke my heart, the lengths you went to hold me
To get to have me, because
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me, but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relived all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me, but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry, it should've been me
I'd be going about my day, until a hand
Would come and lift me out
And drop me in the middle of a labyrinth
Where I'd be stuck a while
When I saw the girl looked just like me, I thought
Must be lonely loving someone
Trying to find their way out of a maze
Oh, I know
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me, but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relived all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me, but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry, it should've been me
I'm sorry, it should've been me


I guess, I guess, I guess this is the end
I'll have to learn to be somebody else
Itâ€™s been you and me since before I was me
Without you, I don't yet know quite how to live
If I could keep anything of you
I would keep just this quiet after you
It's still as a pond I am staring into
From here, I can say, "Thank you"
From here, I can tell you, "Thank you"


We fought again, I ran out the apartment
You say you love me, I believe you do
But I walk down and up and down
And up and down this street
Because you just don't like me
Not like you used to, ooh
That's our lamp, it shines like a big moon
We may be ending, I'm standing in the dark
Looking up into our room, where you'll be waiting for me
Thinking that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me, ooh
Thinking that's where you loved me, that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me, that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me, that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me, that's where you loved me
