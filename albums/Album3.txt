It's beautiful out today
I wish you could take me upstate
To the little place you would tell me about
When you'd sense that I'd want to escape
Texas is a land-locked state
It's a little bit far away
From the water, from the home that I've wanted to make
It somehow, in the city, you make it there and you make it
Anywhere, anywhere
But I've been anywhere and it's not what I want
I wanna be still with you
You keep your socks on in bed
Keep our hearth warm
"See the trees' shadows lie in black pools in the lawns"
You're the breeze in my Austin nights
You're the breeze in my Austin nights
You're the breeze in my Austin nights




There's a party and we're all going
And we're all growing up
Somebody's driving and he will be drinking
And no one's going back
'Cause we've tried hungry and we've tried full
And nothing seems enough
So tonight, tonight, the boys are gonna go
For more, more, more
And I want a love that falls as fast as a body from the balcony
And I want to kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat
Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be
Smell that, it's wet grass, and smoke in my hair
I think I've had enough
But he wants a finale and I came prepared
And we're not going back
And I've tried sharing and I've tried caring
And I've tried putting out
But the boys, boys, boys keep coming on
For more, more, more
And change, change, change is gonna come, but
When, when, when?
And I want a love that falls as fast
As a body from the balcony, and
I want to kiss like my heart is chasing me down
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat
Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be
And I want a love that falls as fast
As a body from the balcony, and
I want to kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat
Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be
I'm not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be
I wanna be what my body wants me to be


The black hole of the window where you sleep
The night breeze carries something sweet, a peach tree
Wild women don't get the blues, but I find that
Lately, I've been crying like a tall child
So please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't", so I can crawl back in
And I was so young when I behaved twenty-five
Yet now, I find I've grown into a tall child
And I don't wanna go home yet
Let me walk to the top of the big night sky
Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't", so I can crawl back in
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't", so I can crawl back in
Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe


I don't know what to do without you
I don't know where to put my hands
I've been trying to lay my head down
But I'm writing this at 3 a.m
I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me
On sunny days, I go out walking
I end up on a tree-lined street
I look up at the gaps of sunlight
I miss you more than anything
I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me
And autumn comes when you're not yet done
With the summer passing by, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me


I don't smoke, except for when I'm missing you
To remember your mouth, how it tasted true
And I don't smoke, except for after I've held you, baby
Being with you makes the flame burn good
So if you need to be mean, be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
If your hands need to break more than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm as you break my heart
I'm what's left of when we swam under the moon
Now the rest of my days are just waiting for when
You've calmed down and tell me, "I was meant for you"
Baby, being with you makes the flame burn good
If you need to be mean, be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
If your hands need to break more than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm as you break my heart
Just don't leave me alone wondering where you are
I am stronger than you give me credit for
If your hands need to break more than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm as you break my heart


It's a windy afternoon, can't afford to buy my food
Or the drive I need to go further than they said I'd go
He only loves me when there's a means he means to end
Oh, I miss when we first met, he didn't know me yet
So take me out, baby
Makes no difference where we'll be
As long as we're out in the sun
Take me out, baby
(As long as we're out in the sun)
Take me out, baby
Doesn't matter where we'll be
But please under the light of day
Take me out, take me out
Take me out, baby
Take me out toâ€“


I will retire to the Salton Sea at the age of 23
For I'm starting to learn I may never be free
But though I may never be free
Fuck you and your money, I'm tired of your money
And I sit on the curb 'cause it's the prettiest night
With no one else in sight
You know I wore this dress for you
These killer heels for you
See the dark, it moves
With every breath of the breeze


I will take good care of you, I will take good care of you
Everything you feel is good if you would only let you
I will wash your hair at night and dry it off with care
I will see your body bare and still I will live here
So stay with me, hold my hand
There's no need to be brave
And all the quiet nights you bear, seal them up with care
No one needs to know they're there, for I will hold them for you
'Cause all I ever wanted is here, all I ever wanted
All I want is always you, it's always you
And we're not out of the tunnel
I bet you, though, there's an end
Stay with me, hold my hand
There's no need to be brave
And while you sleep, I'll be scared
So by the time you wake, I'll be brave
I'll be brave, I'll be brave


At night on the roof top, I untie my hair
And watch from my plastic chair
As my dark hair unleashes the night
The scent of flowers
Still in bloom from morning shower
And I say your name in hopes you'll hear it in the stars
And carry me out
Carry me out
I drive when it rains at night, when it rains, I drive
And the headlight spirits, they lead me down the Styx
So black it shines
And carry me out
Carry me out
At night on the roof top, I untie my hair
And watch from my plastic chair
As my dark hair unleashes the night


All of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
Apologies from the intercom
And I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
They'll think of me kindly when they come for my things
They'll never know how I'd stared at the dark in that room
With no thoughts like a blood-sniffing shark
And while my dreams made music in the night
Carefully, I was going to live
You wouldn't leave 'til we loved in the morning
You'd learned from movies how love ought to be
And you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
But I know through mine, you were looking in yours
And did you know the Liberty Bell is a replica
Silently housed in its original walls
And while its dreams played music in the night
Quietly, it was told to believe
I always wanted to die clean and pretty
But I'd be too busy on working days
So I am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
I couldn't have changed anyways
I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
Goodbye
