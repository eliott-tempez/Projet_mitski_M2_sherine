I'm beautiful, I know 'cause it's the season
But what am I to do with all this beauty?
Biology, I am an organism, I'm chemical
That's all, that is all
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life, I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe about to fall, capture me
Or at least take my picture
I'm pulsing, my blood is red and unafraid of living
Beginning to end
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life, I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe about to fall
How I feel this river rushing through my veins
With nowhere else to go, it circles 'round
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life, I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe about to fall, capture me


You're home, you're home, you're home to me
So leave me, leave me, leave me a map
I'm here at my cliff looking down
I cannot bear you a son
But I will try
For if I am not yours, what am I?
I daydream I'd give one a name of my own
For I, even I, even I am on loan
I have, I have, I watch a dream breaking
Breaking, breaking, breaking me
Away from my cliff, I am looking down from
I cannot bear you a son
I have tried
But if I am not yours, what am I?
I daydream I'd give him a name of my own
For I, even mine, even mine is unknown
So let me go towards the morning star
With hope it won't disappear
I am hungry
I have been hungry
I was born hungry
What do I need?
I am something
I have been something
I was born something
What could I be?
There is a light that I can see
But only, it seems, when there's darkness in me
There is a dream that I sometimes see
That only appears in the dark of sleep
I am waiting
I have been waiting
I was born waiting
I was born waiting
For that something
Just to want something
I was born something
I was born
There is a light, I feel it in me
But only, it seems, when the dark surrounds me
There is a dream and it sleeps in me
To awake in the night, crying "Set me free"
And I awake every night, crying "Set me free"
One, two
Honey, what'd you take?
Think my brain is rotting in places
I think my heart is ready to die
I think my body is falling in pieces
I think my blood is passing me by
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
I think my fate is losing its patience
I think the ground is pulling me down
I think my life is losing momentum
I think my ways are wearing me down
But if I gave up on being pretty, I wouldn't know how to be alive
I should move to a brand new city and teach myself how to die
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
You like control, well, I do too
Take off my clothes and watch me move
You can come closer, I'll let you hurt me
How you choose
Help me with the zipper on my skirt, it's stuck
As you kneel, I'll be watching you fix me
This view of you, of the top of your head makes me forgive you
But how long, how long can we play this way?
I'm tired, I'm tired of not loving you
My heart, my heart wants to hold you
But I know, I know, I know the rules
Blue light, dark room, the white of your teeth
As you smile at my trembling shoulders
But your skin, did you notice your skin?
It cries a soft weep like mine
I'll sell, I'll sell my whole to you
What's my, what's my, what's my price?
How 'bout, how 'bout just a part of you?
'Cause I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want
I'm all used up, pretty boy
Over and over again, my nail colors are wearing off
See my hands, pretty boy
What do they tell you?
'Cause I've looked down at them, not knowing why
And after everything's done and I'm all undone
You can hear my high heels walking on
Clickety-clacking through the night
I'm carrying my bag of bones
Fluorescent store lights, you shine through the night
Illuminate my pores and you tear me apart
Mercy on me, would you please spare me tonight?
I'm tired of this searching, would you let me let go?
I know my room is a mess
Over and over again I tell myself I'll clean tomorrow
Just move the stuff up off the bed
And do what you came here to do
But first, open up a window for me
And let the cool air in, feel the night slip in
As it softly glides along your back


And I hope you leave right before the sun comes up
So I can watch it alone
Fluorescent store lights, you shine through the night
Illuminate my pores and you tear me apart
Mercy on me, would you please spare me tonight?
I'm tired of this searching, would you let me let go?
And I can take a little bit more
Let's shake this poet out of the beast
Just a, just a little bit more
Let's shake this poet out of the beast
There is a door to me
I've never seen it
Sometimes I get closer to it
But I've never found it
At twilight, I almost had it
But then the night fell
I looked out at the dark and wondered
How could I have lost it?
Then, one night, at the park I saw it
With my cheek in the dirt
I couldn't move underneath the dark
But at least I finally found it
Cried out a creak and opened
To show me what's beyond it
A hopeless violence
I named it love
Treasure hunter, you are dead
The light of the world is fading
You cannot see the other end
Your body's lost all feeling
Those creatures of your woken mind
Don't fear them or their hunger
Forgive the sea, follow the tide
With the monsters on your shoulder
Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down
Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down
Oh, hunter, if you didn't want
The beautiful so badly
Perhaps you would've found it
In your spirit singing softly
But hunter, you were human
Don't forget it and go safely
And I, I'll live without you
Though the struggle will be daily
Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down
Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down
Treasure hunter, you are dead
The light of the world is fading
