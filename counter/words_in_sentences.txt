the :	2	56	as they brace for the ground
the :	2	72	and the grass where you lay left a bed in your shape

the :	2	175	but right outside the door nobody knows
the :	2	176	they're right outside the door and they don't know how it
the :	2	182	i can still smell the fire
the :	2	184	the smoke still hangs in my hair
the :	2	190	i once lived in the sea
the :	2	192	the tide where i used to be
the :	2	206	that now i can't tell the truth
the :	2	209	and in the morning i walked home alone
the :	2	210	and the businessmen saw my bones
the :	2	211	with my skirt in their eyes they remembered the nights
the :	2	216	there's the lie that i told to you
the :	2	219	it was only to tease when he climbed up the tree
the :	2	223	and that was so long ago now the tree it has grown
the :	2	241	for the other girls to pursue
the :	3	3	to the little place you would tell me about
the :	3	7	from the water from the home that i've wanted to make
the :	3	8	it somehow in the city you make it there and you make it
the :	3	14	see the trees' shadows lie in black pools in the lawns
the :	3	15	you're the breeze in my austin nights
the :	3	16	you're the breeze in my austin nights
the :	3	17	you're the breeze in my austin nights
the :	3	28	so tonight tonight the boys are gonna go
the :	3	30	and i want a love that falls as fast as a body from the balcony
the :	3	31	and i want to kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
the :	3	41	but the boys boys boys keep coming on
the :	3	46	as a body from the balcony and
the :	3	52	as a body from the balcony and
the :	3	53	i want to kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
the :	3	61	the black hole of the window where you sleep
the :	3	62	the night breeze carries something sweet a peach tree
the :	3	63	wild women don't get the blues but i find that
the :	3	73	let me walk to the top of the big night sky
the :	3	89	i don't need the world to see
the :	3	90	that i've been the best i can be but
the :	3	95	i look up at the gaps of sunlight
the :	3	97	i don't need the world to see
the :	3	98	that i've been the best i can be but
the :	3	102	with the summer passing by but
the :	3	110	being with you makes the flame burn good
the :	3	115	i'm what's left of when we swam under the moon
the :	3	116	now the rest of my days are just waiting for when
the :	3	118	baby being with you makes the flame burn good
the :	3	130	or the drive i need to go further than they said i'd go
the :	3	135	as long as we're out in the sun
the :	3	137	as long as we're out in the sun
the :	3	140	but please under the light of day
the :	3	146	i will retire to the salton sea at the age of 23
the :	3	150	and i sit on the curb 'cause it's the prettiest night
the :	3	154	see the dark it moves
the :	3	155	with every breath of the breeze
the :	3	164	and all the quiet nights you bear seal them up with care
the :	3	168	and we're not out of the tunnel
the :	3	173	so by the time you wake i'll be brave
the :	3	177	at night on the roof top i untie my hair
the :	3	179	as my dark hair unleashes the night
the :	3	180	the scent of flowers
the :	3	182	and i say your name in hopes you'll hear it in the stars
the :	3	186	and the headlight spirits they lead me down the styx
the :	3	190	at night on the roof top i untie my hair
the :	3	192	as my dark hair unleashes the night
the :	3	196	apologies from the intercom
the :	3	199	they'll never know how i'd stared at the dark in that room
the :	3	201	and while my dreams made music in the night
the :	3	203	you wouldn't leave 'til we loved in the morning
the :	3	207	and did you know the liberty bell is a replica
the :	3	209	and while its dreams played music in the night
the :	3	213	so i am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
the :	4	1	happy came to visit me he bought cookies on the way
the :	4	6	oh if you're going take the train
the :	4	10	i was in the bathroom i didn't hear him leave
the :	4	11	i locked the door behind him and i turned around to see
the :	4	12	ooh all the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
the :	4	15	if you're going take the train
the :	4	19	and if you're going take the moon
the :	4	20	then maybe i will see you; in the night i'll see you
the :	4	36	when no one was home and he would stop to hear the door
the :	4	46	in the rearview mirror i saw the setting sun on your neck
the :	4	47	and felt the taste of you bubble up inside me
the :	4	54	atop of every roof in the city of my heart
the :	4	60	atop of every roof in the city of my heart
the :	4	75	and i'll listen to the memories as they
the :	4	78	the gentleman won't say a word
the :	4	79	but you know oh you know in the quiet he holds
the :	4	83	and i'll listen to the memories as they
the :	4	87	and i'll listen to the memories as they
the :	4	97	you're the sun you've never seen the night
the :	4	98	but you hear its song from the morning birds
the :	4	99	well i'm not the moon i'm not even a star
the :	4	100	but awake at night i'll be singing to the birds
the :	4	106	you're the one
the :	4	112	i guess i couldn't help trying to be the best american girl
the :	4	122	i know they're losing and i pay for my place by the ring
the :	4	126	i know they're losing and i pay for my place by the ring
the :	4	140	i wanna see the whole world
the :	4	141	i wanna see the whole world
the :	4	143	i wanna see the whole world
the :	4	164	glory glory glory to the night
the :	4	166	as i go to the party on my knees
the :	4	172	glory glory glory to the night
the :	4	185	if the loving feeling makes you all alone
the :	4	197	if the loving feeling makes you all alone
the :	4	201	if the loving feeling makes you all alone
the :	4	208	blank open eyes watch the moonflower bloom
the :	4	210	all these twenty years trying to fill the void
the :	4	244	and i am the fire and i am the forest
the :	4	251	and i'll love the littler things
the :	5	1	you're my number one you're the one i want
the :	5	4	you're my number one you're the one i want
the :	5	7	'cause you're the one i got you're the one i got
the :	5	8	so i'll keep turning down the hands
the :	5	12	and hear the harmony only when it's harming me
the :	5	14	but i will be the one you need
the :	5	15	the way i can't be without you
the :	5	16	i will be the one you need
the :	5	45	every time i drive through the city where you're from
the :	5	61	and all the things i don't talk about
the :	5	95	in the morning in a taxi
the :	5	109	i need something bigger than the sky
the :	5	116	i need something bigger than the sky
the :	5	123	i steal a few breaths from the world for a minute
the :	5	126	and all of the things i have seen will be gone
the :	5	138	and i'm the idiot with the painted face
the :	5	139	in the corner taking up space
the :	5	155	come into the water
the :	5	159	'til you come into the water
the :	5	160	maybe i'm the same as all those men
the :	5	168	my god i'm so lonely so i open the window
the :	5	192	i glow pink in the night in my room
the :	5	210	is the heart of a horse
the :	5	216	but i had circled the same old sin
the :	5	238	i'm walking 'round the house naked silver in the night
the :	5	248	it's funny how they're all the same
the :	5	256	and the ground has been slowly pulling us back down
the :	6	1	let's step carefully into the dark
the :	6	15	i cry at the start of every movie
the :	6	17	but i'm working for the knife
the :	6	19	but nobody cared for the stories i had about
the :	6	21	i always knew the world moves on
the :	6	23	i start the day high and it ends so low
the :	6	24	'cause i'm working for the knife
the :	6	26	now at twenty-nine the road ahead appears the same
the :	6	28	that i'm living for the knife
the :	6	29	i always thought the choice was mine
the :	6	31	i start the day lying and end with the truth
the :	6	32	that i'm dying for the knife
the :	6	42	to where the dark remembers you
the :	6	44	like the gates of hell
the :	6	58	like the gates of hell
the :	6	73	and i left the door open to the dark
the :	6	77	after some big hand turns out the light
the :	6	78	and i opened my arms wide to the dark
the :	6	87	heat lightning running outside the window
the :	6	90	on the ceiling dancing are the things all come and gone
the :	6	96	sleeping eyelid of the sky flutters in a dream
the :	6	98	trees are swaying in the wind like sea anemones
the :	6	110	i'll be the only heartbreaker
the :	6	111	i'll be the only heartbreaker
the :	6	112	i'll be the only heartbreaker
the :	6	113	so i'll be the loser in this game
the :	6	114	i'll be the bad guy in the play
the :	6	115	i'll be the water main that's burst and flooding
the :	6	116	you'll be by the window only watching
the :	6	117	i'll be the only heartbreaker
the :	6	118	i'll be the only heartbreaker
the :	6	123	and make me the only heartbreaker
the :	6	124	so i'll be the only heartbreaker
the :	6	128	i won't make the same mistake
the :	6	138	there's the itch
the :	6	179	give her all the love
the :	6	185	but you're the only one
the :	6	194	when i saw the girl looked just like me
the :	6	195	and it broke my heart the lengths you went to hold me
the :	6	200	relived all the ways you still want me
the :	6	206	and drop me in the middle of a labyrinth
the :	6	208	when i saw the girl looked just like me i thought
the :	6	215	relived all the ways you still want me
the :	6	222	i guess i guess i guess this is the end
the :	6	233	we fought again i ran out the apartment
the :	6	240	we may be ending i'm standing in the dark
of :	1	6	and feel my skin is plump and full of life i'm in my prime
of :	1	10	i'm pulsing my blood is red and unafraid of living
of :	1	13	and feel my skin is plump and full of life i'm in my prime
of :	1	19	and feel my skin is plump and full of life i'm in my prime
of :	1	30	i daydream i'd give one a name of my own
of :	1	38	i daydream i'd give him a name of my own
of :	1	53	that only appears in the dark of sleep
of :	1	103	this view of you of the top of your head makes me forgive you
of :	1	105	i'm tired i'm tired of not loving you
of :	1	108	blue light dark room the white of your teeth
of :	1	114	how 'bout how 'bout just a part of you
of :	1	124	i'm carrying my bag of bones
of :	1	128	i'm tired of this searching would you let me let go
of :	1	143	i'm tired of this searching would you let me let go
of :	1	145	let's shake this poet out of the beast
of :	1	147	let's shake this poet out of the beast
of :	1	165	the light of the world is fading
of :	1	168	those creatures of your woken mind
of :	1	189	the light of the world is fading
of :	2	13	there's some kind of burning inside me
of :	2	51	what is that quiet of snow in the night
of :	2	54	maybe it's all of these snowflakes screaming
of :	2	55	a choir of mute
of :	2	143	and it's the end of the world
of :	2	157	and it's the end of the world
of :	2	218	but it's up in a branch of a tree
of :	3	61	the black hole of the window where you sleep
of :	3	68	jump off of this ledge i'm on baby
of :	3	73	let me walk to the top of the big night sky
of :	3	77	jump off of this ledge i'm on baby
of :	3	80	jump off of this ledge i'm on baby
of :	3	95	i look up at the gaps of sunlight
of :	3	112	i can take it and put it inside of me
of :	3	115	i'm what's left of when we swam under the moon
of :	3	116	now the rest of my days are just waiting for when
of :	3	120	i can take it and put it inside of me
of :	3	140	but please under the light of day
of :	3	146	i will retire to the salton sea at the age of 23
of :	3	149	fuck you and your money i'm tired of your money
of :	3	155	with every breath of the breeze
of :	3	158	i will take good care of you i will take good care of you
of :	3	168	and we're not out of the tunnel
of :	3	180	the scent of flowers
of :	3	195	all of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
of :	3	198	they'll think of me kindly when they come for my things
of :	4	4	so he laid me down and i felt happy come inside of me
of :	4	9	i'll make no more use of it when there's no more you
of :	4	12	ooh all the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
of :	4	18	i'll make no more use of it when there's no more you
of :	4	22	i'll make no more use of it when there's no more you ooh
of :	4	28	he would smile and let one of his hands go
of :	4	35	'cause dan had never danced outside of his room
of :	4	38	of course you couldn't know it was you and you alone
of :	4	47	and felt the taste of you bubble up inside me
of :	4	54	atop of every roof in the city of my heart
of :	4	60	atop of every roof in the city of my heart
of :	4	71	and when i find that a knife's sticking out of my side
of :	4	96	and i have nothing ahead of me
of :	4	102	your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
of :	4	109	your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
of :	4	113	your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
of :	4	138	my body's made of crushed little stars
of :	4	241	i'm tired of wanting more i think i'm finally worn
of :	4	242	for you have a way of promising things
of :	5	25	i look for a picture of you
of :	5	58	you're growing tired of me
of :	5	60	you're growing tired of me
of :	5	102	i gave too much of my heart tonight
of :	5	125	and all of my memories
of :	5	126	and all of the things i have seen will be gone
of :	5	161	writing songs of all they're dreaming
of :	5	169	to hear sounds of people to hear sounds of people
of :	5	170	venus planet of love was destroyed by global warming
of :	5	198	with every drop of rain singing
of :	5	210	is the heart of a horse
of :	6	8	by dancing ghosts as they kick up clouds of sand
of :	6	12	and maybe they'll finally float off of me
of :	6	15	i cry at the start of every movie
of :	6	44	like the gates of hell
of :	6	51	thinking of you
of :	6	58	like the gates of hell
of :	6	69	everyone all of them
of :	6	71	so of course to that i said
of :	6	96	sleeping eyelid of the sky flutters in a dream
of :	6	190	well i went through my list of friends and found
of :	6	192	of this overwhelming clean feeling
of :	6	206	and drop me in the middle of a labyrinth
of :	6	210	trying to find their way out of a maze
of :	6	226	if i could keep anything of you
my :	1	6	and feel my skin is plump and full of life i'm in my prime
my :	1	8	i'm at my highest peak i'm ripe about to fall capture me
my :	1	9	or at least take my picture
my :	1	10	i'm pulsing my blood is red and unafraid of living
my :	1	13	and feel my skin is plump and full of life i'm in my prime

as :	5	253	if we were young again but as it is and it is
as :	5	260	if we were young again but as it is and it is
as :	6	8	by dancing ghosts as they kick up clouds of sand
as :	6	109	but i think for as long as we're together
as :	6	228	it's still as a pond i am staring into
i :	1	1	i'm beautiful i know 'cause it's the season
i :	1	2	but what am i to do with all this beauty
i :	1	3	biology i am an organism i'm chemical
i :	1	16	how i feel this river rushing through my veins
i :	1	27	i cannot bear you a son
i :	1	28	but i will try
i :	1	29	for if i am not yours what am i
i :	1	30	i daydream i'd give one a name of my own
i :	1	31	for i even i even i am on loan
i :	1	32	i have i have i watch a dream breaking
i :	1	34	away from my cliff i am looking down from
i :	1	35	i cannot bear you a son

i :	1	37	but if i am not yours what am i
i :	1	38	i daydream i'd give him a name of my own
i :	1	39	for i even mine even mine is unknown
i :	1	42	i am hungry

i :	1	44	i was born hungry
i :	1	45	what do i need
i :	1	46	i am something
i :	1	47	i have been something
i :	1	48	i was born something
i :	1	49	what could i be

i :	1	56	i was born waiting
i :	1	57	i was born waiting
i :	1	60	i was born something
i :	1	61	i was born
i :	1	62	there is a light i feel it in me
i :	1	66	and i awake every night crying set me free
i :	1	70	i think my heart is ready to die
i :	1	71	i think my body is falling in pieces
i :	1	72	i think my blood is passing me by
i :	1	79	i think my fate is losing its patience
i :	1	80	i think the ground is pulling me down
i :	1	81	i think my life is losing momentum
i :	1	82	i think my ways are wearing me down
i :	1	83	but if i gave up on being pretty i wouldn't know how to be alive
i :	1	84	i should move to a brand new city and teach myself how to die
i :	1	97	you like control well i do too
i :	1	107	but i know i know i know the rules
i :	1	115	'cause i want i want i want i want i want i want i want i want i want

i :	1	130	over and over again i tell myself i'll clean tomorrow
i :	1	138	and i hope you leave right before the sun comes up
i :	1	139	so i can watch it alone
i :	1	144	and i can take a little bit more
i :	1	150	sometimes i get closer to it
i :	1	152	at twilight i almost had it
i :	1	154	i looked out at the dark and wondered
i :	1	155	how could i have lost it
i :	1	156	then one night at the park i saw it
i :	1	158	i couldn't move underneath the dark
i :	1	159	but at least i finally found it
i :	1	163	i named it love
i :	1	182	and i i'll live without you
i :	2	2	it took me a while till i knew
i :	2	4	it just took me a while till i knew
i :	2	5	now i lay as i study a blank wall
i :	2	6	would you spare me your voice if i call
i :	2	9	so i don't blame you if you want to
i :	2	10	bury me in your memory i'm not the girl i ought to be but
i :	2	12	can tell them what you saw in me and not how i turned out to be
i :	2	17	now here i lay as i wonder about you
i :	2	21	and i don't blame you if you want to
i :	2	22	bury me in your memory i'm not the girl i ought to bebut

i :	2	44	so lying awake i would follow the aching inside
i :	2	45	i would find
i :	2	47	i tried my hardest for i'd never learned

i :	2	50	but i was still waiting for something to earn

i :	3	147	for i'm starting to learn i may never be free
i :	3	148	but though i may never be free
i :	3	150	and i sit on the curb 'cause it's the prettiest night

i :	3	185	i drive when it rains at night when it rains i drive
i :	3	190	at night on the roof top i untie my hair
i :	3	197	and i am relieved that i'd left my room tidy
i :	3	202	carefully i was going to live
i :	3	206	but i know through mine you were looking in yours
i :	3	211	i always wanted to die clean and pretty
i :	3	213	so i am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
i :	3	214	i couldn't have changed anyways
i :	3	215	i am relieved that i'd left my room tidy
i :	4	2	i poured him tea and he told me it'll all be okay
i :	4	3	well i told him i'd do anything to have him stay with me
i :	4	4	so he laid me down and i felt happy come inside of me
i :	4	5	he laid me down and i felt happy
i :	4	7	so i can hear it rumble one last rumble
i :	4	10	i was in the bathroom i didn't hear him leave
i :	4	11	i locked the door behind him and i turned around to see
i :	4	13	well i sighed and mumbled to myself again i have to clean
i :	4	14	i sighed and mumbled to myself
i :	4	16	so i can hear it rumble one last rumble
i :	4	20	then maybe i will see you; in the night i'll see you
i :	4	46	in the rearview mirror i saw the setting sun on your neck
i :	4	53	then i wouldn't have to scream your name
i :	4	55	if i could see you once more to see you
i :	4	59	then i wouldn't have to scream your name
i :	4	61	if i could see you if i could see you once more to see you
i :	4	62	if i could see you once more to see you
i :	4	66	and i will forget how to cry
i :	4	69	i will go jogging routinely
i :	4	71	and when i find that a knife's sticking out of my side
i :	4	77	i will be married to silence
i :	4	93	if i could i'd be your little spoon
i :	4	96	and i have nothing ahead of me
i :	4	101	don't wait for me i can't come
i :	4	103	but i do i think i do
i :	4	105	i guess i couldn't help trying to be your best american girl

i :	4	108	i think i'll regret this
i :	4	110	but i do i finally do

i :	5	174	and i know no one will save me i just need someone to kiss
i :	5	180	and i know no one will save me i'm just asking for a kiss
i :	5	192	i glow pink in the night in my room
i :	5	194	and i hear my heart breaking tonight

i :	5	205	i didn't do it right
i :	5	206	can i try again try again try again
i :	5	215	i thought i'd traveled a long way
i :	5	216	but i had circled the same old sin
i :	5	222	i thought maybe we would kiss tonight
i :	5	227	i know who you pretend i am
i :	5	228	i know who you pretend i am
i :	5	251	it's funny how i still forgot
i :	6	3	who will i be tonight
i :	6	4	who will i become tonight
i :	6	15	i cry at the start of every movie
i :	6	16	i guess 'cause i wish i was making things too
i :	6	18	i used to think i would tell stories
i :	6	19	but nobody cared for the stories i had about
i :	6	21	i always knew the world moves on
i :	6	22	i just didn't know it would go without me
i :	6	23	i start the day high and it ends so low
i :	6	25	i used to think i'd be done by twenty
i :	6	29	i always thought the choice was mine
i :	6	30	and i was right but i just chose wrong
i :	6	31	i start the day lying and end with the truth
i :	6	49	i am face down on my bed
i :	6	52	i tuck my hand under my weight
i :	6	56	'cause i could be your stoker
i :	6	71	so of course to that i said
i :	6	72	i think i'll go that way
i :	6	73	and i left the door open to the dark
i :	6	74	i said come in come in whatever you are
i :	6	78	and i opened my arms wide to the dark
i :	6	79	i said take it all whatever you want
i :	6	80	i didn't know that i was young
i :	6	81	i didn't know what it would take
i :	6	82	i didn't know what it would take
i :	6	83	sometimes i think i am free
i :	6	84	until i find i'm back in line again
i :	6	91	and there's nothing i can do not much i can change
i :	6	92	so i give it up to you i hope that's okay
i :	6	93	there's nothing i can do not much i can change
i :	6	94	i give it up to you i surrender
i :	6	99	and there's nothing i can do not much i can change
i :	6	100	can i give it up to you would that be okay
i :	6	101	there's nothing i can do not much i can change
i :	6	102	i give it up to you i surrender
i :	6	103	there's nothing i can do not much i can change
i :	6	104	i give it up to you i surrender
i :	6	109	but i think for as long as we're together
i :	6	119	i apologize
i :	6	121	i apologize
i :	6	127	if i keep myself at home
i :	6	128	i won't make the same mistake
i :	6	129	that i made for fifteen years
i :	6	130	i could be a new girl
i :	6	131	i will be a new girl
i :	6	132	i wish that this would go away
i :	6	134	i will have to find something else
i :	6	140	i need you to love me more
i :	6	144	i need you to love me more
i :	6	149	i wonder how they keep it up

go :	6	177	so go on to that sweetheart's door
and :	1	6	and feel my skin is plump and full of life i'm in my prime
and :	1	10	i'm pulsing my blood is red and unafraid of living
and :	1	13	and feel my skin is plump and full of life i'm in my prime
and :	1	19	and feel my skin is plump and full of life i'm in my prime
and :	1	64	there is a dream and it sleeps in me
and :	1	66	and i awake every night crying set me free
and :	1	84	i should move to a brand new city and teach myself how to die
and :	1	98	take off my clothes and watch me move
and :	1	117	over and over again my nail colors are wearing off
and :	1	121	and after everything's done and i'm all undone
and :	1	126	illuminate my pores and you tear me apart
and :	1	130	over and over again i tell myself i'll clean tomorrow
and :	1	132	and do what you came here to do
and :	1	134	and let the cool air in feel the night slip in
and :	1	138	and i hope you leave right before the sun comes up
and :	1	141	illuminate my pores and you tear me apart
and :	1	144	and i can take a little bit more
and :	1	154	i looked out at the dark and wondered
and :	1	160	cried out a creak and opened
and :	1	181	don't forget it and go safely
and :	1	182	and i i'll live without you
and :	2	7	'cause you waited and watered my heart till it grew
and :	2	12	can tell them what you saw in me and not how i turned out to be
and :	2	15	and i'm sure that you've seen what it's done to my heart
and :	2	19	'cause i've waited and watered my heart till it grew
and :	2	21	and i don't blame you if you want to
and :	2	24	can tell them what you saw in me and not the way i am
and :	2	25	and i don't mean to make your heart blue
and :	2	26	but could we be what we're meant to be i'm just about to beg you please and
and :	2	28	tell them what you saw in me and not the way i used to be
and :	2	37	and i held my breath
and :	2	39	and i wondered what space would i take
and :	2	48	god's very simple and love shouldn't burn
and :	2	49	and i would've offered you all that you yearned for
and :	2	53	as you stand and drown
and :	2	64	god's very simple and love doesn't burn
and :	2	65	and maybe you'd offered me all that i yearned for
and :	2	72	and the grass where you lay left a bed in your shape
and :	2	73	i looked over it and i ached
and :	2	75	i don't need the city and i don't need proof
and :	2	77	i picture it soft and i ache
and :	2	101	it's cool and clean
and :	2	102	it's smooth and it's steady
and :	2	109	and i try i'm trying to pick them up
and :	2	110	but they crack and crumble it's all too much
and :	2	113	and i try i'm trying to pick them up
and :	2	114	but they crack and crumble it's all too much
and :	2	118	all so square and so steady
and :	2	124	and i'm sorry for taking
and :	2	127	and i try i'm trying to pick them up
and :	2	128	but they crack and crumble it's all too much
and :	2	131	and i try i'm trying to pick them up
and :	2	143	and it's the end of the world
and :	2	145	and i love you darling
and :	2	146	and i am done dear
and :	2	148	and i am here in the car
and :	2	157	and it's the end of the world
and :	2	159	and i love you darling
and :	2	160	and i am done dear
and :	2	162	and i am here in the car
and :	2	171	and right outside the door nobody knows
and :	2	172	they're right outside the door and they don't know how it
and :	2	176	they're right outside the door and they don't know how it
and :	2	185	and on some quiet evenings it burns my eyes
and :	2	207	and it ate me inside so one soft drunken night
and :	2	209	and in the morning i walked home alone
and :	2	210	and the businessmen saw my bones
and :	2	222	we forgot and we left for home
and :	2	223	and that was so long ago now the tree it has grown
and :	2	224	and nobody knows my lover is buried underground
and :	2	236	and i'll leave once i figure out
and :	2	239	this once and then we can forget
and :	2	240	and i'll leave what i'm chasing
and :	3	8	it somehow in the city you make it there and you make it
and :	3	10	but i've been anywhere and it's not what i want
and :	3	22	there's a party and we're all going
and :	3	23	and we're all growing up
and :	3	24	somebody's driving and he will be drinking
and :	3	25	and no one's going back
and :	3	26	'cause we've tried hungry and we've tried full
and :	3	27	and nothing seems enough
and :	3	30	and i want a love that falls as fast as a body from the balcony
and :	3	31	and i want to kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
and :	3	35	smell that it's wet grass and smoke in my hair
and :	3	37	but he wants a finale and i came prepared
and :	3	38	and we're not going back
and :	3	39	and i've tried sharing and i've tried caring
and :	3	40	and i've tried putting out
and :	3	43	and change change change is gonna come but
and :	3	45	and i want a love that falls as fast
and :	3	46	as a body from the balcony and
and :	3	51	and i want a love that falls as fast
and :	3	52	as a body from the balcony and
and :	3	67	one word from you and i would
and :	3	70	and i was so young when i behaved twenty-five
and :	3	72	and i don't wanna go home yet
and :	3	76	one word from you and i would
and :	3	79	one word from you and i would
and :	3	101	and autumn comes when you're not yet done
and :	3	109	and i don't smoke except for after i've held you baby
and :	3	112	i can take it and put it inside of me
and :	3	117	you've calmed down and tell me i was meant for you
and :	3	120	i can take it and put it inside of me
and :	3	149	fuck you and your money i'm tired of your money
and :	3	150	and i sit on the curb 'cause it's the prettiest night
and :	3	160	i will wash your hair at night and dry it off with care
and :	3	161	i will see your body bare and still i will live here
and :	3	164	and all the quiet nights you bear seal them up with care
and :	3	168	and we're not out of the tunnel
and :	3	172	and while you sleep i'll be scared
and :	3	178	and watch from my plastic chair
and :	3	182	and i say your name in hopes you'll hear it in the stars
and :	3	183	and carry me out
and :	3	186	and the headlight spirits they lead me down the styx
and :	3	188	and carry me out
and :	3	191	and watch from my plastic chair
and :	3	197	and i am relieved that i'd left my room tidy
and :	3	201	and while my dreams made music in the night
and :	3	205	and you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
and :	3	207	and did you know the liberty bell is a replica
and :	3	209	and while its dreams played music in the night
and :	3	211	i always wanted to die clean and pretty
and :	4	2	i poured him tea and he told me it'll all be okay
and :	4	4	so he laid me down and i felt happy come inside of me
and :	4	5	he laid me down and i felt happy
and :	4	8	and when you go take this heart
and :	4	11	i locked the door behind him and i turned around to see
and :	4	12	ooh all the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
and :	4	13	well i sighed and mumbled to myself again i have to clean
and :	4	14	i sighed and mumbled to myself
and :	4	17	and when you go take this heart
and :	4	19	and if you're going take the moon
and :	4	21	and when you go take this heart
and :	4	27	and when she'd ask to hold hands
and :	4	28	he would smile and let one of his hands go
and :	4	30	and when he'd say goodnight and leave her doorstep
and :	4	32	and once back in his room once back in his room
and :	4	36	when no one was home and he would stop to hear the door
and :	4	37	so when he moved with you and felt his body let go
and :	4	38	of course you couldn't know it was you and you alone
and :	4	43	and he would never tell you that it was his first time
and :	4	47	and felt the taste of you bubble up inside me
and :	4	50	so come inside and be with me
and :	4	56	come inside and be with me
and :	4	66	and i will forget how to cry
and :	4	67	i'll keep going to work and you won't see a change
and :	4	70	calmly and rhythmically run
and :	4	71	and when i find that a knife's sticking out of my side
and :	4	73	and then one warm summer night
and :	4	75	and i'll listen to the memories as they
and :	4	81	and then one warm summer night
and :	4	83	and i'll listen to the memories as they
